# Description
 - The app is a complete solution for those learners who really want to improve their english speaking skills. Here the user can conversate with the ai and after the conversation they can even check the better way of saying the sentence they have already spoken in a chat like interface so that they can learn from there mistakes. And inorder to track their progress we also have the progress tracking mechanism which will help user to track his/her improvement.


# Tech Stack

1. **React-Native**: We chose react-native because using it we can create the application compatible for both android as well as ios at the same time.

2. **Node.js** && **Express.js** : This helps us to create the server for our application, making it easy to handle the voice requests from the user and providing the required response to it as well.

3. **Ollama** : Here is the place where our model is running (model is running locally in the server but by the help of ollama)

# Installation steps:

## Applicaiton setup

1. You can clone our repository.
2. You have to make an android studio setup first so that you can run our application.
3. After setting up the android studio, you can connect your phone with the usb to the laptop.
4. Open the project inside any IDE or VScode and naviagate through the `App` directory and write `npm install` in the terminal after that write `npm run android`.

## Server setup

1. After setting up the App, open another terminal
2. Navigate through the server directory and hit the `npm install` in the terminal and then `npm run dev`.
3. And server will also start running on the port 3000.

## Additional setup

1. You have to navigate through every "fetch" or "axios" written code and have to change the domain from `192.168.208.216` to `127.0.0.1`.

# Libraries and Dependencies
